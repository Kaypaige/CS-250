# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
# I interpret user needs by clarifying their expectations through active communication and providing examples to confirm understanding. Creating user stories helps translate vague or broad feedback into specific, actionable features—like identifying a filtering function from general customer requests during the travel agency project.

# How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
# I approach development by first validating the user story, then planning with pseudocode or flowcharts, asking questions when uncertain, and using best practices like test-driven development. In future projects, I hope to incorporate Agile values such as strong team collaboration, open communication, and reduced bureaucracy to enhance creativity and efficiency.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
# Being a good team member means offering constructive feedback, supporting others' growth, stepping up when help is needed, and continually learning to better serve your team, company, and users.
